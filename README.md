## 📌 Problem Statement

Many university students face difficulty in clearing interviews due to lack of practice, structured feedback, and exposure to real interview environments.
Existing mock interview tools often ask static questions and fail to adapt based on the candidate’s resume or responses.

MockStar addresses this gap by providing a **realistic, adaptive, and AI-powered mock interview experience** for students within the university ecosystem.
